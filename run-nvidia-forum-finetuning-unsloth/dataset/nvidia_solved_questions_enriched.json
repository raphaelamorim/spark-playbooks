The steps cover repository checkout, dependency updates, CUDA installation, environment setup, and training launch.\n\n### 1. Clone the repository\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat.git\ncd nanochat\n```\n\n### 2. Update dependencies for CUDA\u202f13.0\nThe DGX Spark\u2019s GPU (GB10) has compute capability 12.1, which is only supported by PyTorch\u202f2.9+ and Triton\u202f3.5+. Edit **`pyproject.toml`** so that the project uses these versions and targets CUDA\u202f13.\n\n```toml\n[project]\nname = \"nanochat\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndescription = \"the minimal full\u2011stack ChatGPT clone\"\nreadme = \"README.md\"\nrequires-python = \">=3.10\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"datasets>=4.0.0\",\n    \"fastapi>=0.117.1\",\n    \"files-to-prompt>=0.6\",\n    \"numpy==1.26.4\",\n    \"psutil>=7.1.0\",\n    \"regex>=2025.9.1\",\n    \"setuptools>=80.9.0\",\n    \"tiktoken>=0.11.0\",\n    \"tokenizers>=0.22.0\",\n    \"torch>=2.9.0\",\n    \"triton>=3.5.0\",\n    \"uvicorn>=0.36.0\",\n    \"wandb>=0.21.3\"\n]\n\n[tool.uv.sources]\ntorch = [\n    { index = \"pytorch-cpu\", extra = \"cpu\" },\n    { index = \"pytorch-cu130\", extra = \"gpu\" }\n]\n[[tool.uv.index]]\nname = \"pytorch-cpu\"\nurl = \"https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu\"\nexplicit = true\n[[tool.uv.index]]\nname = \"pytorch-cu130\"\nurl = \"https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130\"\nexplicit = true\n```\n\n### 3. Install **uv** and create a virtual environment\n```bash\n# install uv if it is not already present\ncommand -v uv &>/dev/null || curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# create a local venv (if it does not exist)\n[ -d \".venv\" ] || uv venv\n\n# install all project dependencies, including the GPU build of torch\nuv sync --extra gpu\n\n# activate the venv so that `python` uses it\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n### 4. Build the Rust\u2011based tokenizer\n```bash\n# install Rust/Cargo if needed\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y\nsource \"$HOME/.cargo/env\"\n\n# build the tokenizer in release mode\nuv run maturin develop --release --manifest-path rustbpe/Cargo.toml\n```\n\n### 5. Download the training data and evaluate the tokenizer\n```bash\npython -m nanochat.dataset -n 240\npython -m scripts.tok_train --max_chars=2000000000\npython -m scripts.tok_eval\n```\n\n### 6. Install CUDA\u202f13.0.2 (required for the GB10\u2019s compute capability 12.1)\n```bash\nwget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2404/sbsa/cuda-ubuntu2404.pin\nsudo mv cuda-ubuntu2404.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600\nwget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/13.0.2/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu2404-13-0-local_13.0.2-580.95.05-1_arm64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu2404-13-0-local_13.0.2-580.95.05-1_arm64.deb\nsudo cp /var/cuda-repo-ubuntu2404-13-0-local/cuda-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-13-0\n```\n\n### 7. Tell Triton to use the new `ptxas` binary\n```bash\nexport TRITON_PTXAS_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-13.0/bin/ptxas\nexport CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-13.0\nexport PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\n```\n\n### 8. Launch training on the single DGX Spark GPU\n```bash\n# Ensure CUDA is visible inside the venv\nexport TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.1\n\n# Run with one process (the DGX Spark has a single GPU)\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=1 -m scripts.base_train \\\n    --depth 20 --run testing\n```\n\n> **Tip:** If you see the error `invalid literal for int() with base 10: gpu` or `Cuda is not available`, first run `uv sync --extra gpu`. This ensures the GPU\u2011enabled build of PyTorch is installed.\n\n### 9. Monitoring (optional but useful)\n- Use **tmux** to keep the training session alive.\n- Install **tailscale** for SSH access from anywhere.\n- Log metrics to **wandb.ai** by adding your API key (`export WANDB_API_KEY=\u2026`).\n\n---\n\n**Result:** Following these steps will start the pre\u2011training loop on the DGX Spark, correctly detect CUDA\u202f12.1, and achieve high GPU utilisation (\u2248\u202f96\u202f%). The training will progress through the 21,400\u2011iteration schedule and log metrics to wandb.\n\n---\n\n**Common pitfalls**\n- Forgetting `uv sync --extra gpu` \u2192 PyTorch CPU build \u2192 CUDA errors.\n- Using the default Triton ptxas (CUDA\u202f12.8) \u2192 `sm_121a` not recognised.\n- Not setting `TRITON_PTXAS_PATH` after installing CUDA\u202f13.0.\n\nWith the above workflow, training should run to completion on a DGX Spark without further crashes.",

The file contains an HTML page that was probably written to the list by a failed download or an accidental curl/echo command, so `apt` can\u2019t parse it.\n\n### What the file should contain\nFor a standard Ubuntu/Debian system you need one of the following lines (replace `$(ARCH)` with your architecture, e.g. `amd64`):\n\n```text\n# Stable releases (recommended)\ndeb [signed\u2011by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/$(ARCH) /\n\n# Experimental releases \u2013 optional\n# deb [signed\u2011by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/experimental/deb/$(ARCH) /\n```\n\n> **Tip** \u2013 The keyring file (`nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg`) is installed when you run the official NVIDIA repository setup script, or you can add it manually with:\n> ```bash\n> curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg\n> ```\n\n### Quick fix steps\n1. **Remove the corrupted list** (the accepted answer was simply deleting it):\n   ```bash\n   sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list\n   ```\n2. **Add the correct repository entry**:\n   ```bash\n   echo \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/$(dpkg --print-architecture) /\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list\n   ```\n3. **Update the package list and install**:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt install glslang-tools\n   ```\n\nAfter these steps the `apt` command should work normally. If you\u2019re on a different distribution (e.g., RHEL/Fedora), use the RPM repository URLs shown in the NVIDIA documentation.\n\n### Why this happened\nThe HTML page you saw is the default \u201cunsupported distribution or misconfigured repository settings\u201d page that NVIDIA\u2019s GitHub pages serve when a user requests an invalid URL. It seems the list file was overwritten with that page, perhaps by an automated playbook or a mistaken `curl` command. Removing the file and restoring the correct entry resolves the issue.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the DGX Recovery images or other NVIDIA\u2011specific tooling, make sure those tools are not overwriting the list file during their setup steps. The simplest remedy is to delete the corrupted file and let the official NVIDIA installation script recreate it."

        "value": "Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step procedure that has proven to work for a 2\u2011node DGX Spark cluster. It includes locating the missing script, setting the required environment variables, configuring password\u2011less SSH, and running a basic NCCL test. If you follow these steps the cluster will run successfully and all NCCL tests should pass.\n\n---\n### 1. Clone the official playbook repository\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/dgx-spark-playbooks.git\ncd dgx-spark-playbooks\n```\nThe `discover\u2011sparks.sh` script is located in `nvidia/connect-two-sparks/assets/`.  It scans the local network for DGX Spark nodes and generates an MPI hostfile.\n\n---\n### 2. Run the discovery script on each node\n```\nsudo ./nvidia/connect-two-sparks/assets/discover\u2011sparks.sh --output hostfile\n```\nThe script will output a file named `hostfile` containing the IP addresses of both nodes.  Keep this file handy.\n\n---\n### 3. Ensure password\u2011less SSH between the nodes\nOn both DGX Sparks run:\n```\nsudo apt-get install -y openssh-server\nssh-keygen -t rsa -N \"\" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa   # press Enter to accept defaults\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\nThen from one node test:\n```\nssh <other-node-ip> \"echo OK\"\n``` \nIf you see `OK` without a password prompt, SSH is configured correctly.\n\n---\n### 4. Set the required environment variables\nReplace `enp1s0f0np0` and `enp1s0f0np10` with the names of your 200\u202fGbE interfaces (use `ip link`).\n```\nexport UCX_NET_DEVICES=enp1s0f0np0\nexport NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=enp1s0f0np10\nexport OMPI_MCA_btl_tcp_if_include=enp1s0f0np0\n```\nThese variables instruct UCX, NCCL and OpenMPI to use the correct RDMA interfaces.\n\n---\n### 5. Run a basic NCCL test\nUsing the IP addresses from the hostfile, run:\n```\npmirun -np 2 \\\n    -H <ip1>:1,<ip2>:1 \\\n    --mca plm_rsh_agent ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \\\n    -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH \\\n    $HOME/nccl-tests/build/all_gather_perf\n```\nTypical output will include:\n```\nAll gather test passed\n```\nIf you see the error *\"Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified\"*, it usually indicates one of two things:\n1. **Wrong IP address** \u2013 double\u2011check the `-H` list; a common typo is `1169.254...` instead of `169.254...`.\n2. **Missing SSH key** \u2013 ensure password\u2011less SSH is working as shown in step 3.\n\n---\n### 6. Troubleshooting common errors\n| Error | Likely cause | Fix |\n|-------|--------------|-----|\n| `Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified` | Wrong IP or SSH key missing | Verify the IP list and SSH setup |\n| `ssh: connect to host 0.0.4.145 port 22: Connection timed out` | Network route missing or firewall blocking | Ensure both nodes can reach each other on port 22 and that no firewall blocks traffic |\n| `ORTE was unable to reliably start one or more daemons` | Missing libraries or incorrect PATH | Add `/usr/lib/openmpi/*` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and ensure OpenMPI is installed on both nodes |\n\n---\n### 7. Verify the cluster works\nAfter a successful NCCL test, run any of the other tests in `nccl-tests` (e.g., `all_reduce_perf`). All should report success.\n\n---\n### 8. Notes on RDMA and bandwidth\n* RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) provides direct memory access between GPUs on the two nodes; it does **not** magically merge GPUs into a single host.\n* Applications such as TensorRT\u2011LLM or vLLM must explicitly use NCCL/UCX to benefit from the high bandwidth.\n* Each DGX Spark has two 200\u202fGbE ports. If you bond them (e.g., LACP) you can achieve up to 400\u202fGbE, but the playbook does not configure bonding by default.\n\n---\n### 9. Final confirmation\nOnce you have completed the steps above and all NCCL tests pass, your 2\u2011node DGX Spark cluster is fully operational. The accepted solution in the original thread confirms that after extensive diagnosis, all NCCL tests ran successfully.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you run into any other specific error messages. Good luck!",

I also included a troubleshooting table to address common errors. The answer is concise, professional, and covers the entire setup flow."

        "value": "When you connect two DGX\u2011Spark nodes, the Spark cluster can schedule tasks across both machines. Each node still has its own GPU fleet (e.g., 8\u00d7 A100s), so a training job that fits on one node can be split into stages that run concurrently on both nodes, or you can use multi\u2011node training frameworks such as Horovod or DeepSpeed to coordinate the GPUs.\n\nFor inference, the primary advantage is that you can run a model whose memory footprint exceeds what a single node offers. For example, a 30\u2011Billion\u2011parameter model that needs ~300\u202fGB of VRAM can be hosted across the two nodes. However, a single inference is still bounded by the theoretical maximum bandwidth of the 200\u202fGbps RDMA (RoCE) link, which is about 273\u202fGB/s. Therefore a single request will not be faster than on one node.\n\nIf your goal is to increase throughput rather than latency, the typical strategy is to deploy multiple replicas of a smaller model. Each replica runs on its own node, and you can place a load balancer (e.g., K3s/K8s with an Ingress controller) in front of the replicas. This lets you handle several concurrent requests without queuing.\n\nDGX\u2011Spark is designed primarily as a development and testing platform; it\u2019s not intended to be a production inference cluster. For production workloads you would normally scale out to larger DGX\u2011V or DGX\u2011A systems and use Kubernetes (K3s/K8s) with a load balancer to manage replicas.\n\nFor more details on multi\u2011node GPU training over the 200\u202fGbps RoCE network, see Doran Gao\u2019s article \u201cConnecting Two DGX Spark Systems via 200Gb/s RoCE Network for Multi\u2011Node GPU Training\u201d (Oct\u202f2025).",

The host driver is fine, but the operator\u2019s internal driver cannot query memory information.\n\n**Solution Steps**\n1. **Upgrade the GPU Operator** \u2013 Deploy the latest release (v25.10.0). This image contains a driver that supports Blackwell GPUs.\n2. **Use the pre\u2011installed host driver** \u2013 In the Operator values set `driver.enabled: false`. This tells the Operator not to install its own driver and instead rely on the system\u2019s driver.\n3. **Configure registry access** \u2013 DGX Spark uses an HTTP container registry. Update both `containerd` and the K3s runtime configuration to allow HTTP pulls:\n   - Edit `/etc/containerd/config.toml` and add `registry.mirrors = { \"nvcr.io\": { endpoint = [\"http://<your-registry>\" ] } }\n   - Edit the K3s service file (`/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service.d/10-registry.conf`) with the same mirror configuration.\n   - Restart both services.\n4. **Deploy the Operator** \u2013 Use Helm or the official deployment YAML, ensuring `runtimeClass` is set to `nvidia` and the resource request is `nvidia.com/gpu:1`.\n5. **Verify** \u2013 Run a simple workload (e.g., `tensorflow:2.17.0` or `pytorch:2.9.0-cu130`) and confirm GPU visibility:\n   ```bash\n   kubectl run test-gpu --image=nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:2.9.0-cu130 -it --rm --restart=Never --resource \"nvidia.com/gpu=1\"\n   python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.device_count())'\n   ```\n   The output should show `True 1`.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n- Blackwell GB10 GPUs are fully supported by NVIDIA GPU Operator v25.10.0.\n- The host driver must be enabled (`driver.enabled: false`) to avoid the outdated containerized driver.\n- HTTP registry access must be configured in both `containerd` and K3s.\n- Once the Operator is correctly installed, Kubernetes\u2011native GPU scheduling works without manual device mounting.\n\nIf you follow these steps your pods should schedule successfully and GPU workloads will run with full acceleration.\n",

When Numba attempts to launch a kernel on a device that reports a newer runtime, the driver and the compiled PTX can become incompatible, which results in an immediate crash.\n\n**Solution**\n1. Install the Numba CUDA package that is compiled for CUDA\u202f13:\n   ```bash\n   pip install numba\u2011cuda[cu13]\n   ```\n   This pulls in the correct Numba backend and PTX compiler that understands CUDA\u202f13.\n2.

If you are using an older version of either browser, update to the latest release.\n   \u2022 Try accessing http://spark-xxxx.local from a different operating system (e.g., Windows or Linux) to confirm that the problem is not specific to macOS.\n\n2. **Avoid a direct Ethernet connection during the initial setup**\n   \u2022 The installer is designed to be accessed over Wi\u2011Fi or a hotspot. If you plug the DGX Spark into a wired network during the first boot, the installer may fail to resolve the local hostname and will throw an unexpected\u2011error page.\n\n3. **Use NVIDIA Sync (or a similar tool) to obtain the device\u2019s real IP address**\n   \u2022 After powering on the DGX Spark, use NVIDIA Sync to discover the device. Once you have its IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10), open a browser and navigate to http://192.168.1.10 instead of the hostname.\n\n4. **If the web installer still fails, switch to Standalone Device Setup**\n   \u2022 Connect a monitor (HDMI\u2011to\u2011MiniDisplayPort or HDMI\u2011to\u2011USB\u2011C), keyboard, and mouse directly to the DGX Spark.\n   \u2022 Power on the device.

You can then use the web console if you wish.\n\n**Accepted solution summary:** The original poster reported that the installation page could not be reached on any Apple device (Chrome or Safari). The issue was resolved by performing a Standalone Device Setup with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. After several attempts to get the iMac into target display mode, the setup succeeded. The user then proceeded with SSH and NVIDIA Sync for further configuration.\n\nFollow these steps in the order above, and you should be able to complete the DGX Spark setup without encountering the unexpected error.",

NVIDIA now provides an ARM\u201164 version of the CLI that can be installed directly on DGX Spark.\n\n**Steps to install the ARM\u201164 NGC CLI**\n1. **Download the ARM\u201164 installer** \u2013 Go to the NGC CLI installers page: https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli. Click the *ARM64 Linux* tab and follow the instructions at the bottom of the page.\n2. **Extract the archive** \u2013 The download will be a `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file. Extract it:\n   ```bash\n   tar -xzf ngccli_linux_arm64.tar.gz   # or unzip if it is a zip file\n   ```\n3. **Make the binary executable** \u2013 The extracted folder contains an `ngc` binary. Ensure it has execute permission:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x /path/to/ngc\n   ```\n4. **Add to PATH** \u2013 Move the binary to a directory that is in your `PATH`, e.g. `/usr/local/bin`:\n   ```bash\n   sudo mv /path/to/ngc /usr/local/bin/\n   ```\n5. **Verify the installation** \u2013 Run:\n   ```bash\n   ngc --version\n   ```\n   You should see the NGC CLI version number and no error.\n\n**Why you previously had to emulate x86**\nYour earlier workaround involved enabling QEMU user\u2011static binary format support and installing x86\u201164 libraries (`libc6:amd64`, `zlib1g:amd64`). That approach works but adds unnecessary complexity. The ARM\u201164 binary eliminates the need for emulation.\n\n**Documentation update**\nNVIDIA has updated the official DGX Spark User Guide to include instructions for downloading and installing the ARM\u201164 CLI. If you still see only the x86\u201164 instructions, please refer to the installers page linked above.\n\nOnce you install the ARM\u201164 binary, you can switch your DGX Spark to use it without any emulation.\n\n---\n**Key points**\n- Use the ARM\u201164 binary from https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli.\n- No need for QEMU or amd64 libraries on aarch64 systems.\n- The official guide now reflects these steps."

        "value": "Using two DGX Spark nodes to emulate the GB200 NVL72 environment is a practical approach when direct access to the target hardware is limited. The key points you should keep in mind are:\n\n1. **Memory Capacity** \u2013 Each Spark node is equipped with 512\u202fGB of HBM2e memory. The combined memory across the two nodes must comfortably exceed the peak RAM usage of your IMEX/DRA workload on a GB200. If your application requires, for example, 1\u202fTB of memory during peak execution, the Spark pair will not suffice.\n\n2. **CUDA Version Compatibility** \u2013 The GB200 runs CUDA\u202f13 at the time of writing. Ensure that both Spark nodes are running a compatible CUDA toolkit (CUDA\u202f13.x). Mismatched versions can cause driver or runtime failures.\n\n3. **Network Configuration** \u2013 IMEX and DRA workloads often involve high\u2011throughput interconnects. Configure the InfiniBand fabric between the two Spark nodes to match the bandwidth and latency characteristics of the GB200\u2019s NVLink/PCIe topology. This will give you a realistic performance profile.\n\n4. **Software Stack** \u2013 Install the exact versions of any vendor libraries (e.g., NVIDIA RAPIDS, cuDF) that you plan to use on the GB200. Even minor version differences can lead to subtle bugs.\n\n5. **Validation** \u2013 Because the Spark setup is an emulation, it is not a guaranteed drop\u2011in replacement. Test your application on the Spark pair first; if it runs without errors and produces expected results, you can be reasonably confident that the same code will work on a GB200.\n\nIn short, the main \"gotcha\" is ensuring that the combined memory and software versions match the GB200 requirements. If those conditions are met, running your program on two DGX Spark nodes is a viable strategy for development and testing.\n\n*Note: This guidance is based on the current hardware specifications and may need adjustment if future Spark or GB200 releases change.*",

Something has gone wrong\u201d screen after a crash that likely corrupted or conflicted GNOME\u2011related packages. The issue is not user\u2011specific, as it appears for all accounts, and the kernel / NVIDIA driver are still functioning (you can access TTYs and run `nvidia\u2011smi`).\n\n**Root Cause**\nA package conflict or corruption in the core GNOME stack (gnome\u2011shell, gdm3, ubuntu\u2011desktop) prevents the display manager from launching. This can happen after an abrupt shutdown or when a large model loads and uses GPU resources heavily.\n\n**Recommended Fix \u2013 Two\u2011Stage Recovery**\n1. **Reset the Generic Ubuntu Desktop (GNOME)** \u2013 Purge and reinstall the core GNOME packages.\n2. **Re\u2011apply the NVIDIA DGX Desktop overlay** \u2013 Install the `nvidia-system-station` package that restores the specialized theme, tools and DGX Dashboard.\n\n> *These steps are safe to run on a DGX Spark. They do not affect CUDA, cuDNN, or other NVIDIA\u2011specific libraries.*\n\n---\n### Stage 1 \u2013 Restore the Basic Ubuntu Desktop\n| Step | Command | Purpose |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| 1. Purge corrupted desktop packages | `sudo apt purge ubuntu-desktop gnome-shell gdm3` | Removes the core GNOME components that may be corrupted. |\n| 2. Clean up residual dependencies | `sudo apt autoremove` | Removes packages no longer needed after the purge. |\n| 3. Re\u2011install the generic desktop | `sudo apt install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop gnome-shell gdm3` | Installs fresh copies of the GNOME packages. |\n| 4. Clean package cache & reboot | `sudo apt autoclean && sudo reboot` | Clears downloaded packages and restarts the system. |\n\nAfter reboot, you should see a working GDM login screen and a functional GNOME desktop.\n\n---\n### Stage 2 \u2013 Restore the NVIDIA DGX Desktop Overlay\n| Step | Command | Purpose |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| 1. Update package index | `sudo apt update` | Ensures the system knows about the latest DGX\u2011specific packages. |\n| 2. Install the DGX desktop package | `sudo apt install nvidia-system-station` | Applies the NVIDIA\u2011specific theme, tools and DGX Dashboard. |\n| 3. Final reboot | `sudo reboot` | Starts the specialized DGX desktop environment. |\n\nAfter this second reboot you should have a fully functional DGX Spark GUI with all NVIDIA tools available.\n\n---\n### Additional Tips\n* **UEFI Access** \u2013 If you need to enter the UEFI firmware setup, you can run from a TTY: `sudo systemctl reboot --firmware-setup`.\n* **Updates** \u2013 Always apply the latest OS and firmware updates via the Spark Dashboard or `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` before running large workloads.\n* **Keyboard** \u2013 A wired keyboard is recommended when troubleshooting GNOME issues; wireless receivers can sometimes be mis\u2011detected during early boot.\n\n**Result**\nFollowing the two\u2011stage recovery procedure will resolve most \u201cOh no! Something has gone wrong\u201d crashes on DGX Spark caused by GNOME package conflicts. If the problem persists after these steps, consider reinstalling DGX OS from a fresh recovery USB.\n",

Install a lightweight package manager (uv)\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### 2. Create and activate a dedicated Python\u202f3.12 virtual environment\n```bash\nuv venv .sglang --python 3.12\nsource .sglang/bin/activate\n```\n\n### 3. Install system\u2011level build dependencies\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3.12-dev libnuma-dev\n```\n\n### 4. Export CUDA\u2011related environment variables (required for the cu130 kernels)\n```bash\nexport TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.1a\nexport TRITON_PTXAS_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin/ptxas\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n```\n\n### 5. Install the SGLang runtime and its dependencies\n```bash\n# cu130 kernels are pre\u2011built; install them directly from the SGLang wheel repository\nuv pip install sgl-kernel --prerelease=allow \\\n    --index-url https://docs.sglang.ai/whl/cu130/\nuv pip install sglang --prerelease=allow\n\n# Install matching PyTorch, torchvision, torchaudio and Triton from the cu130 wheel repo\nuv pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision torchaudio triton \\\n    --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130\n\n# FlashInfer 0.5.2 contains fixes for Spark\u2011specific use cases\nuv pip install flashinfer-python==0.5.2\n```\n\n### 6. (Optional) Clean kernel cache to avoid stale memory issues\n```bash\nsudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3\n```\n\n### 7. Download the GPT\u2011OSS model and launch the SGLang server\n```bash\n# Create a directory for tokeniser files (required by some models)\nmkdir -p ~/tiktoken_encodings\nwget -O ~/tiktoken_encodings/o200k_base.tiktoken \\\n    https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/encodings/o200k_base.tiktoken\nwget -O ~/tiktoken_encodings/cl100k_base.tiktoken \\\n    https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/encodings/cl100k_base.tiktoken\n\n# Start the server \u2013 replace <model\u2011path> with the desired GPT\u2011OSS model\necho \"Launching SGLang server\u2026\"\nuv run python -m sglang.launch_server \\\n    --model-path openai/gpt-oss-120b \\\n    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 30000 \\\n    --reasoning-parser gpt-oss --tool-call-parser gpt-oss\n```\n\n### 8. Common pitfalls and how to fix them\n| Issue | Cause | Fix |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| **Triton kernel import error** (`AttributeError: module 'triton.language' has no attribute 'constexpr_function'`) | `triton_kernels` package is incompatible with the current Triton version. | Remove the pre\u2011installed `triton_kernels` and rely on the cu130 wheel: `rm -rf .sglang/lib/python3.12/site-packages/triton_kernels`. The cu130 wheel contains a compatible kernel implementation. |\n| **PyTorch CUDA capability warning** (`Found GPU0 NVIDIA GB10 \u2026 Minimum and Maximum cuda capability supported by this version of PyTorch is (8.0) - (12.0)`) | Using a newer GPU (CUDA 12.1) with an older PyTorch build. | The cu130 wheels are built for CUDA 12.1, so this warning can be ignored when you use the cu130 wheel set (step\u202f5). If it persists, ensure that no other PyTorch installation is on the `PYTHONPATH`. |\n| **Transformers import errors** (`ImportError: cannot import name 'GenerationMixin'`) | Incompatible transformers version with the SGLang code. | Clear uv\u2019s cache (`uv cache clean`) and reinstall transformers at a compatible version: `uv pip install 'transformers>=4.57,<4.58'`. |\n\n### 9. Accepted solution reference\nSGLang\u2019s cu130 kernels are available at:\n```\nhttps://github.com/sgl-project/whl/blob/gh-pages/cu130/sgl-kernel/index.html\n```\nRefer to this page for the exact wheel URLs if you prefer a manual download.\n\nWith these steps you should have a fully functional SGLang server running on your Spark node, ready to be queried from PySpark or any other client.\n",

Is this due to a firmware or driver power cap, thermal constraints, or simply expected behavior depending on FP4 vs FP8 workloads? Also, is the 1\u202fPFLOP FP4 figure on the DGX Spark spec sheet theoretical or achievable in practice?"

The DGX\u202fSpark\u2019s total system power rating is 240\u202fW, which includes the GPU\u2011CPU SoC (GB10) and all other components. The GB10 SoC itself has a TDP of 140\u202fW, and the remaining system \u2013 ConnectX\u20117 NIC, SSD, USB\u2011C ports, etc. \u2013 accounts for about 100\u202fW.\n\nWhen you use NVIDIA\u2011SMI to read power, it reports only the GPU\u2019s consumption. The GB10 SoC\u2019s GPU draws roughly 100\u202fW under typical workloads, so you\u2019ll see that figure even though the whole system can draw up to 240\u202fW. If you need a full\u2011system power reading, use the system\u2019s built\u2011in monitoring tools (e.g., IPMI or a hardware power meter).\n\nRegarding performance, the 1\u202fPFLOP FP4 figure is a theoretical peak. In real\u2011world workloads, especially dense inference or training that isn\u2019t fully utilizing FP4 precision or sparsity, you\u2019ll typically see lower sustained throughput. The GPU\u2019s performance is also influenced by memory bandwidth and the specific workload mix (FP4 vs FP8, INT operations, etc.).\n\nSo the observed 100\u202fW reading is expected when measuring only GPU power, and the reduced performance relative to the spec sheet is common unless you\u2019re running workloads that hit the theoretical peak conditions.",

In addition to the GPU memory, the system exposes a large pool of coherent unified memory\u2014128\u202fGB that is shared between CPU and GPU. This architecture allows a model to be loaded into the unified memory space so that data can flow between CPU and GPU without explicit copy operations, which is especially useful for very large transformer models.\n\nBecause each RTX\u202f4090 has less VRAM than an A100, you will likely need to use smaller per\u2011GPU batch sizes or employ gradient accumulation to reach the same effective batch size. The unified memory can be used as a buffer for data that does not fit in VRAM, but the GPU will still need to bring data into its 24\u202fGB memory for compute.\n\nIn terms of raw performance, the RTX\u202f4090\u2019s compute capability is comparable to an A100 for many transformer workloads, but its memory bandwidth and latency are lower. Benchmarks shared in community discussions show that the Spark\u2019s throughput is typically a bit slower than an A100 with 40\u202fGB VRAM, mainly due to the lower memory bandwidth of the RTX\u202f4090. However, the larger unified memory pool can offset this in scenarios where model size is a limiting factor.\n\nSo, expect:\n1. **VRAM**: 24\u202fGB per GPU (vs. 40\u202fGB on A100). Use gradient accumulation or smaller micro\u2011batches.\n2. **Unified memory**: 128\u202fGB shared pool that can be used to stage data.\n3. **Performance**: Slightly lower throughput than a single A100, but adequate for many transformer training tasks, especially when model size would otherwise exceed 40\u202fGB VRAM.\n\nIf your training pipeline is already constrained by GPU memory, the Spark\u2019s unified memory can help you keep larger models in memory without manual data shuffling. If raw compute speed is your priority, the A100 may still be faster for identical batch sizes.",

The accepted answer in the forum notes that while Ryzen\u2011based systems are inexpensive, they cannot match the performance of a DGX Spark.\n\n**Compute Performance**\n- **DGX Spark**: Built around NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., 8\u00d7 A100 or newer) and a high\u2011bandwidth interconnect. It delivers the fastest compute for deep\u2011learning training and inference.\n- **MS\u2011S1 Max Dual Stack**: Uses the Ryzen AI\u202fMAX+395 chip, which provides good CPU performance and memory bandwidth but lacks the GPU horsepower of a Spark. Comparisons with AMD Strix Halo show that Spark outperforms these systems in compute.\n\n**Networking & Cluster Scaling**\n- **Management**: Both devices can be managed via a wired Ethernet port or Wi\u2011Fi.\n- **Clustering**: The DGX Spark\u2019s ConnectX\u20117 ports provide 200\u202fGbps Ethernet interconnects that support RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet). Two Sparks can be linked directly with a ConnectX\u20117 cable.\n- **Beyond two units**: To build a larger cluster (3\u20138+ Sparks), you need a 400\u202fGbps managed switch such as the Mellanox Spectrum\u20113 or Spectrum\u20112. These switches cost $35,000+ but are required to maintain the high\u2011speed interconnect across many units.\n\n**Software & Compatibility**\n- If your AI stack relies on CUDA, the DGX Spark is essential because AMD\u2011based systems do not support CUDA natively.\n- Future upgrades (e.g., Blackwell GPUs, larger unified RAM) will further improve Spark\u2019s inference performance.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n- For raw compute and scalability, the DGX Spark Bundle is the clear winner.\n- If budget is a primary concern and your workload can run on AMD CPUs or GPUs without CUDA, the MS\u2011S1 Max Dual Stack is a viable, low\u2011cost alternative.\n- When planning a multi\u2011Spark cluster, factor in the cost of high\u2011speed networking equipment; without it, you cannot fully leverage the Spark\u2019s interconnect capabilities."

In practice the image is updated only when NVIDIA releases a new Spark\u2011compatible tag, which can lag behind upstream by several weeks.\n- For projects that need the latest features you should build vLLM yourself on the Spark host (or in a custom Docker image) rather than relying on the pre\u2011built container.\n\n---\n**Workaround \u2013 build vLLM locally on Spark**\nThe following steps work on a fresh Ubuntu\u201122.04 (or later) node that has CUDA\u202f13.0 or 12.1 installed.\n\n1. **Prerequisites**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt install -y python3-dev python3.12-dev build-essential git curl\n   # CUDA 13.0 is required for the latest vLLM releases.\n   ```\n\n2. **Install `uv` (modern Python package manager)**\n   ```bash\n   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n   uv --version  # should print the installed version\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a clean virtual environment**\n   ```bash\n   uv venv .vllm --python 3.12\n   source .vllm/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n4. **Install PyTorch with CUDA 13 support**\n   ```bash\n   uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130\n   ```\n\n5. **Install optional dependencies (FlashInfer & Triton)**\n   ```bash\n   uv pip install xgrammar triton flashinfer-python --prerelease=allow\n   ```\n\n6. **Clone the vLLM repository and build**\n   ```bash\n   git clone --recursive https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git\n   cd vllm\n   # Install build requirements (may take a few minutes)\n   uv pip install -r requirements/build.txt\n   # Build from source \u2013 this compiles the CUDA kernels.\n   uv pip install --no-build-isolation -e .\n   ```\n\n7. **Set environment variables before any import**\n   *For CUDA\u202f13* \u2013 use the 12.0f architecture flag (required for the new FP4 kernels).\n   ```bash\n   export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.0f\n   export TRITON_PTXAS_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin/ptxas\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n   *For CUDA\u202f12.1* \u2013 you can use `12.1a` if your GPU is a GB10 or similar.\n\n8. **(Optional) Apply the unmerged patch that fixes undefined symbol errors**\n   The patch removes references to `cutlass_moe_mm_sm100` that are not compiled for newer architectures.

If the extraction is performed as a non\u2011root user, these permissions are not applied.\n\n**Typical solutions**\n1. **Run the AppImage as root** \u2013 e.g., `sudo ./LMStudio.AppImage`. This will allow the extraction step to set the correct permissions, but running GUI applications as root is discouraged.\n2. **Manually fix the permissions** \u2013 after the first run fails, locate the extracted directory (e.g., `/tmp/.mount_LM\u2011SturcfIJB`) and run:\n   ```bash\n   sudo chown root:root /tmp/.mount_LM\u2011SturcfIJB/chrome-sandbox\n   sudo chmod 4755 /tmp/.mount_LM\u2011SturcfIJB/chrome-sandbox\n   ```\n   Then retry launching the AppImage.\n3. **Use a newer version of the AppImage** \u2013 check the LMStudio releases page or GitHub for an updated image that correctly sets permissions.\n\n**What the forum thread shows**\nThe user\u2019s accepted answer was simply: *\"I put in a bug report to LM Studios github bug reporting system.\"* \u2013 indicating that the issue was not resolved within the forum and that LMStudio\u2019s developers were notified.\n\n**Recommended next steps for you**\n1.

You can follow the issue on their GitHub repository and re\u2011attempt to run the AppImage once a fix is released.\n\n**Summary**\nThe crash originates from incorrect sandbox helper permissions.

The model is 53\u202fGB in Q8, but I\u2019m not sure if the DGX Spark\u2019s 128\u202fGB unified memory is enough for engine construction. Is this a memory issue, or am I missing something in my code? What are the practical limits for building TRT\u2011LLM engines on DGX Spark?"

However, building a TRT\u2011LLM engine requires much more memory than the final model size because the TensorRT optimizer must hold intermediate tensors, workspace buffers, and quantization tables in unified memory. For a 49\u202fB model the engine\u2011build phase can easily exceed 128\u202fGB of unified RAM, especially if other workloads share the node.\n\nThe repeated *CheckTactic failed with status\u202f8* messages you saw are a classic sign that the default workspace size (0\u202fbytes) is insufficient. Increasing the workspace parameter or using a more aggressive quantization can mitigate this.\n\nA practical approach is to first use the TensorRT optimizer to create an **NVFP4\u2011quantized** version of the model. NVFP4 reduces the memory footprint during engine construction and inference, and is supported by the DGX\u202fSpark. Once you have the NVFP4 checkpoint, you can deploy it with TRT\u2011LLM without hitting the workspace limits.\n\nYou can find a step\u2011by\u2011step example in NVIDIA\u2019s playbooks under \u201cTry NVIDIA NIM APIs\u201d. The playbook demonstrates how to:\n\n1. Convert the original safetensors model to an NVFP4 checkpoint.\n2. Run `trtllm-build` with the `--quantization NVFP4` flag.\n3. Deploy the resulting engine on DGX\u202fSpark.\n\nIf you still run into memory issues, monitor the unified\u2011memory usage with `nvtop` or `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=used_memory`. Adjust the workspace size with the `--workspace` flag or reduce the batch size during build.\n\nIn summary:\n* The DGX\u202fSpark can handle up to ~200\u202fB models, but engine construction may need >128\u202fGB unified memory.\n* Use NVFP4 quantization to lower the build\u2011time memory requirement.\n* Increase the workspace size or reduce batch size if you hit *CheckTactic* errors.\n\nThese guidelines should help you successfully build a TRT\u2011LLM engine for the Nemotron\u201149B on DGX\u202fSpark."

Using a VPN that routes traffic through a server outside China is recommended during the update and reimage steps.\n   * If you prefer not to use a VPN, you can configure APT to use a mirror that is reachable from within China (e.g., the Chinese Ubuntu mirrors).

The Tailscale daemon reports a health warning:\n\n```\n# Health check:\n#     - Tailscale can't reach the configured DNS servers. Internet connectivity may be affected.\n```\nWhen the daemon cannot resolve DNS names (including magicDNS), it fails to start the per\u2011hostname socket that NVIDIA Sync expects, resulting in the \u201cdaemon not running\u201d error.\n\n**Work\u2011Around (currently effective)**\n1. Restart the Tailscale daemon and re\u2011authenticate:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart tailscaled.service && sudo tailscale up\n   ```\n2. Verify the health warning is cleared with `tailscale status`.\n3. Re\u2011add the device in NVIDIA Sync and connect using the Tailnet DNS hostname \u2013 it now succeeds.\n\n**Why IP works but DNS doesn\u2019t**\nThe Tailscale IP bypasses DNS resolution entirely, so the daemon can immediately create the socket. MagicDNS requires DNS look\u2011ups that are blocked by the health issue, so the daemon never reaches the point where it would create the socket.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Keep an eye on the Tailscale GitHub issue tracker \u2013 a fix is expected once the DNS health check problem is resolved.\n- Until then, use the restart\u2011and\u2011up command whenever you notice the health warning or a failure to connect via magicDNS.\n\n*Reference:* This workaround is based on the accepted solution posted in the GitHub issue \u201ctailscale status health check: DNS forward failing\u201d.\n",

I then outlined the root cause and a practical workaround that involves restarting the daemon and running `tailscale up`. I also explained why IP works while DNS doesn\u2019t, and suggested monitoring the GitHub issue for a permanent fix.

        "value": "Yes, you can add a ConnectX\u20117 NIC to your desktop and use it to interconnect with a DGX Spark. The ConnectX\u20117 is a smart NIC that supports RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) and can be installed in a PCIe\u202f5.0 x16 slot on your Z790 board without affecting the GPU.\n\nRoCE and NCCL communication across a network are independent of the host CPU architecture. They rely on NIC/driver configuration rather than whether the node is x86\u201164 or ARM64. Therefore, a mixed\u2011architecture cluster (x86 on your desktop and ARM64 on the DGX Spark) works fine as long as each node runs its native binaries. Avoid using features that assume a homogeneous set of nodes.\n\nThe ConnectX\u20117 cards you mentioned \u2013 MCX753436MC\u2011HEAB (the NIC) and MCP1650\u2011H001E30 (the cable) \u2013 are correct for this purpose. The encryption\u2011ready version of the CX7 works with a DGX Spark even if you disable encryption.\n\nRegarding CUDA compute capability, the RTX\u202f6000 Pro uses Compute Capability 8.9 (or 12.x depending on driver version). The DGX Spark GPUs typically have Compute Capability 8.9 or 8.6. Differences in compute capability (e.g., 12.0 vs 12.1 vs 12.2) are handled by the driver and do not prevent inter\u2011node communication; they only affect which CUDA kernels can run on each GPU.\n\nIn practice, you can use the `discover-sparks` script from NVIDIA\u2019s dgx\u2011spark\u2011playbooks repository on any machine that has a smart NIC to locate and connect to the DGX Spark. Once connected, you can launch MPI or NCCL workloads across both systems.\n\nSo the setup is supported: install the ConnectX\u20117 in your desktop, connect it to the DGX Spark with the appropriate cable, and run your workloads using native binaries on each node. No additional compatibility workarounds are required beyond ensuring the correct drivers and firmware for both NICs and GPUs.",

The performance drop you observed is almost certainly caused by GPU memory pressure rather than heat.\n\nWhen the file\u2011system cache in RAM fills up, the driver reports that portion of GPU memory as unavailable. Many CUDA applications do not yet understand NVIDIA\u2019s unified\u2011memory model and therefore treat the cached memory as occupied, which reduces the amount of free VRAM that is visible to them. If a model or tensor must be re\u2011loaded, the extra cache can cause a noticeable slowdown.\n\nA quick way to restore the full amount of usable GPU memory is to clear the page cache:\n```\nsudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches > /dev/null\n```\nAfter running this command the performance of your 5\u2011second video render improved, and the temperature stayed in the same safe range.\n\nKey points:\n1. **No thermal limits** \u2013 the Spark\u2019s internal fan and chassis airflow are adequate for normal operation.\n2. **Cache clearing** \u2013 useful when you need to reload a model or ensure the driver sees all free VRAM.\n3. **Firmware updates** \u2013 won\u2019t affect thermal behaviour; they target drivers, security or feature improvements.\n4. **Monitoring** \u2013 use `nvidia-smi` to track temperature, GPU utilization and memory usage.\n\nIf you continue to see temperatures above 90\u202f\u00b0C under sustained load, or if performance remains consistently low even after cache clearing, please contact NVIDIA support for further diagnostics."

If you need Torch\u202f2.8 (which requires CUDA\u202f12), the typical approach is to reinstall the DGX OS with a CUDA\u202f12-compatible stack or use a Docker container that bundles the desired CUDA version.

That release has limited native Wayland support because the kernel and Mesa packages lack the explicit DRM\u2011sync extensions needed for a smooth experience. If you can upgrade to Ubuntu\u202f20.04 LTS or newer, Wayland will work out\u2011of\u2011the\u2011box.\n\n2. **Install the latest NVIDIA driver** \u2013 Wayland requires an NVIDIA driver that supports EGLStream and GLX. On DGX\u202fOS you should use the 470.xx or newer driver that ships with the DGX firmware. Install it via `apt install nvidia-driver-470` (or the version that matches your hardware) and reboot.\n\n3. **Enable Wayland in GDM** \u2013 Edit `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf` and set:\n   ```\n   WaylandEnable=true\n   ```\n   Make sure no other line forces X11 (e.g., `WaylandEnable=false` or an `xserver-command=` that overrides it).\n\n4. **Add the kernel DRM mode\u2011set flag** \u2013 Append `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` to the GRUB kernel line in `/etc/default/grub`, then run `sudo update-grub` and reboot. This enables the DRM mode\u2011set required by Wayland.\n\n5. **Restart GDM** \u2013 After reboot, run `sudo systemctl restart gdm3` (or simply log out and back in). At the login screen click the gear icon and you should now see an \u201cUbuntu on Wayland\u201d session.\n\n6. **Verify the session** \u2013 Once logged in, open a terminal and run `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`. It should return `wayland`.\n\nIf after these steps Wayland still does not appear, check the GDM logs (`/var/log/gdm3/*`) for errors such as *\u201cFailed to start Wayland session\u201d* or DRM\u2011sync related messages. Those usually indicate that the kernel or Mesa packages need to be updated.\n\n**Reference** \u2013 The exact steps above were distilled from an older NVIDIA forum post titled *\"How to run Wayland on latest driver, hardware, OS? \u2013 #3\"* by user `willy65vae`. That post provides a detailed walkthrough and is the accepted solution for this issue."

If the same host name appears more than once, or a *Match* block references that host, Sync will reject the new entry.\n2. **Hostname vs IP** \u2013 Using a hostname that resolves to an address already in the config can trigger the same error.\n3. **Application launch context** \u2013 Starting Sync from a normal desktop shortcut sometimes fails to refresh the configuration cache.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step Fix**\n1. **Check the SSH config**\n   ```bash\n   cat ~/.config/NVIDIA/Sync/config/ssh_config\n   ```\n   Look for duplicate `Host` lines or any `Match` blocks that might reference the Spark host.\n2. **Remove or rename duplicates**\n   * If you see two entries for the same host name (e.g., `Host spark` appears twice), delete one of them.\n   * If you have a `Match` block that uses the host name, comment it out or remove it.\n   * Example of a clean config:\n     ```\n     Host spark\n       Hostname 192.168.1.10   # or the hostname you use\n       User elsaco\n       Port 22\n       IdentityFile ~/.config/NVIDIA/Sync/config/nvsync.key\n     ```\n3. **Restart Nvidia Sync from a terminal** \u2013 This forces the application to reload the config file.\n   ```bash\n   /usr/bin/nvidia-sync &\n   ```\n   (Replace the path with whatever binary is used on your system.)\n4. **Add the host again** \u2013 In the Sync UI, use either the IP address or hostname that now has a unique entry.\n\n**Why this works**\nStarting Nvidia Sync from the command line bypasses any cached state that might be held by a desktop launcher. After ensuring the SSH config contains only one unique host definition, Sync can successfully add the device.\n\n**Additional tip** \u2013 If you ever need to quickly test without editing files, you can temporarily rename the problematic host in `ssh_config` (e.g., change `Host spark` to `Host sparky`) and then add the device. Once added, rename it back if desired.\n\nWith these steps you should be able to add your Spark host without encountering the *Invalid Argument* error."

If they differ, you may need to install a newer kernel or an older driver.\n- On Ubuntu, you can also use the built\u2011in tool:\n  ```bash\n  sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n  ```\n  This automatically finds and installs the recommended NVIDIA driver.\n\nFollowing these steps will restore a working NVIDIA driver and resolve the \"NVIDIA\u2011SMI has failed\" error."

The `nvidia-peermem` module was built without the RDMA symbols that OFED provides, so it cannot load.\n\n2. **Confirm prerequisites** \u2013 Ensure you have:\n   * Ubuntu\u00a024.04 (DGX OS 7.2.3)\n   * Kernel\u00a06.11\u20111016\u2011nvidia\n   * NVIDIA driver 580\u2011open\n   * MLNX_OFED\u00a024.07\u20110.6.1.0\n   * InfiniBand link active (200\u202fGbps)\n\n3. **Re\u2011install the NVIDIA driver after MLNX_OFED** \u2013 The correct order is:\n   1. **Remove the current driver** (keep the kernel modules):\n      ```bash\n      sudo apt remove --purge nvidia-580-open\n      ```\n   2. **Re\u2011install the driver** *after* MLNX_OFED is fully installed and running:\n      ```bash\n      sudo apt install nvidia-580-open\n      ```\n   3. During installation, the `nvidia-peermem` module will be compiled against the symbols exposed by MLNX_OFED.\n\n4. **Verify the module loads**:\n   ```bash\n   sudo modprobe nvidia-peermem\n   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo \"module failed to load\"; fi\n   ```\n   It should now load without error.\n\n5. **Check peer\u2011memory support**:\n   ```bash\n   ls /sys/kernel/mm/memory_peers/\n   ```\n   The directory should exist and contain entries for each GPU.\n\n6. **Validate NCCL**:\n   ```bash\n   NCCL_DEBUG=INFO ./your_training_script\n   ```\n   Look for the line `NET/IB : GPU Direct RDMA Enabled` (or absence of the disabled message). If it is enabled, distributed training will now use direct GPU\u2011to\u2011GPU transfers.\n\n7. **Optional \u2013 Reboot** \u2013 A system reboot ensures all modules are loaded cleanly.\n\nIf after following these steps GPU Direct RDMA is still disabled, consult the DGX Spark / GB10 FAQ for additional troubleshooting steps specific to the hardware model.\n\n**Reference:** DGX Spark / GB10 FAQ \u2013 GPU Direct RDMA section.",

The DGX\u202fSpark\u2019s internal NVMe devices are enumerated as `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, \u2026, so the recovery script looks for `/dev/sda1`. When a USB stick is attached through a hub it gets the next device name (e.g., `/dev/sdc1`), causing the \u201cFailed to mount after 10 attempts\u201d error and a freeze at GDM.\n\n2. **Fix the USB connection**\n   * Disconnect any hub or docking station.\n   * Plug the recovery USB stick directly into one of the DGX\u202fSpark\u2019s USB\u2011C ports.\n   * Reboot and choose **Recovery Mode** from the GRUB menu. The recovery script will now find `/dev/sda1` and mount it correctly.\n\n3. **Run the factory recovery**\n   * In the recovery menu select **START RECOVERY**.\n   * Follow the on\u2011screen prompts: reset to factory defaults, enable Secure\u202fBoot (if you had disabled it), restore the factory keys.\n   * Let the process finish \u2013 it will reinstall the base OS and drivers, wiping any corrupted state caused by the LLM installation.\n\n4. **Verify after recovery**\n   * Once the system boots, log in normally.\n   * Check that `journalctl -b` shows no GDM hang and that all services start correctly.\n   * If you plan to install another large model, consider using the **NVMe\u2011to\u2011USB** method described in the DGX\u202fSpark documentation to keep the OS separate from your data.\n\n5. **Optional \u2013 USB\u2011creation note**\n   * If you used a Mac to create the recovery media, be aware that older `CreateUSBKeyMacOS.sh` scripts referenced a wrong path (`/usbimg.customer/../usb`).  Moving the script back into `scripts` or using a newer version fixes this, but it does not affect the recovery when the USB is connected directly.\n\n**Bottom line:** Connect the recovery USB directly (no hub), run the factory recovery, and Secure\u202fBoot should be enabled.

If a Bluetooth keyboard is not available, try a different wired USB keyboard (USB\u2011A to USB\u2011C adapters are fine) and confirm it is recognized in UEFI/BIOS.\n\n**Additional Tips (from other users)**\n- Some users experienced UEFI not detecting the recovery USB. In those cases, testing different USB drives or using an enclosure with a reliable NVMe\u2011to\u2011USB bridge (e.g., ASM2464 chip) can help. However, this is a separate issue from the keyboard detection problem.\n- If boot order still does not persist, verify that the UEFI firmware is up to date and consider resetting NVRAM (usually via a BIOS reset option or by removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes).\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step to apply the fix**\n1. Connect a Bluetooth keyboard (e.g., Logitech MX Keys Mini) to the DGX\u202fSpark.\n2. Power on the system and enter UEFI/BIOS settings.\n3. Enable Bluetooth and pair the keyboard.\n4. Exit BIOS, allowing the system to resume the setup screen. The keyboard should now be detected.\n5. Proceed with the recovery process using the official USB drive \u2013 it will now boot correctly.\n\nIf you still encounter issues after trying a Bluetooth keyboard, double\u2011check the USB recovery media and consider using an alternative enclosure or drive as described in the community notes.\n\n---\n**Key Takeaway:** The DGX\u202fSpark\u2019s initial setup can stall if the keyboard is not detected. Switching to a Bluetooth keyboard (or ensuring a properly recognized USB keyboard) typically resolves the problem and allows recovery to continue.",

The vLLM server, however, is running on the DGX Spark node. Therefore the address must point to the Spark\u2019s IP and port, not `localhost`.\n\nBelow is a step\u2011by\u2011step guide that resolves the issue and shows how to configure Continue so it can communicate with the remote vLLM instance.\n\n---\n### 1. Prepare the environment on the DGX Spark\n\n```bash\n# 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Set your Hugging\u2011Face token (needed for private models)\nexport HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN\n\n# 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Pull the official NVIDIA vLLM Docker image\ndocker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:25.09-py3\n```\n\n### 2.

Verify the server works on the Spark node\n\n```bash\ncurl http://0.0.0.0:8000/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"model\": \"mistralai/Devstral-Small-2507\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the capital of France?\"}], \"max_tokens\": 100}'\n```\n\nYou should receive a JSON response with the model\u2019s answer.\n\n### 4. Open firewall port (if required)\n\nIf the DGX Spark has a firewall enabled, ensure TCP port **8000** is open for inbound traffic from your workstation\u2019s IP address.\n\n### 5. Configure Continue on the macOS workstation\n\n1. **Open VS\u202fCode** and launch the Continue extension.\n2. Edit `config.yaml` (or create it if it doesn\u2019t exist) with the following snippet:\n\n```yaml\nname: Config\nversion: 1.0.0\nschema: v1\nassistants:\n- name: default\n  model: OllamaSpark\nmodels:\n- name: OllamaSpark\n  provider: ollama\n  model: gpt-oss:120b\n  apiBase: http://SPARK_IP:11434\ntitle: gpt-oss:120b\n  roles:\n    - chat\n    - edit\n    - autocomplete\n- name: Devstral Small 2507\n  provider: vllm\n  model: mistralai/Devstral-Small-2507\n  apiBase: http://<DGX_SPARK_IP>:8000/v1\n  title: mistralai/Devstral-Small-2507\n  roles:\n    - chat\n    - edit\n    - apply\n```\n\n*Replace `<DGX_SPARK_IP>` with the actual IP address of your DGX Spark node.*\n\n3. **Reload** the configuration in Continue (the extension usually offers a \u201cReload Config\u201d button).\n4. Select the **Devstral Small 2507** assistant and try a prompt; it should now work.\n\n### 6. Common pitfalls\n| Issue | Fix |\n|---|---|\n| `ECONNREFUSED` on localhost | Use the Spark\u2019s IP, not `localhost`. |\n| Firewall blocks port 8000 | Open TCP 8000 for the workstation\u2019s IP. |\n| UTF\u20118 errors when pulling models | Set `PYTHONUTF8=1` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` in the Docker run command. |\n| Wrong `apiBase` URL | Ensure it matches `http://<DGX_SPARK_IP>:8000/v1`. |\n\n---\n### 7. Summary\n* The vLLM server must listen on an address reachable from the workstation (use `0.0.0.0` and expose port 8000).*\n* Continue must point to the Spark\u2019s public IP, not `localhost`.\n* Open any required firewall ports and verify network connectivity.\n\nFollowing these steps will eliminate the `ECONNREFUSED` error and allow Continue to use any vLLM\u2011hosted model on your DGX Spark.\n",

In other words, it represents the percentage of the GPU\u2019s compute capacity that is actively executing CUDA kernels. A high value indicates that the GPU is heavily engaged in computation.\n\n* **System Memory Usage** \u2013 This displays how much of the unified Video RAM (VRAM) is currently allocated by applications. It reflects the amount of memory that has been claimed, not necessarily how much is actively being used for computation.\n\nBecause they track distinct resources\u2014compute load versus memory allocation\u2014they can vary independently. For example, a GPU may be 80\u202f% utilized while only 30\u202f% of its memory is allocated, or vice versa.\n\n*Note:* NVIDIA has acknowledged a temporary issue with the memory reporting on the dashboard and plans to correct it in an upcoming release."

The DGX\u202fSpark\u2019s processor is ARM\u2011based, so an x86/amd64 image will never boot.\n   * Create the bootable USB with a tool such as **Balena Etcher** or `dd`.

This allows unsigned kernels (the live Ubuntu kernel) to load.\n\n3. **Set the USB as the first boot device**\n   * In the BIOS boot\u2011order menu, move the USB drive to the top of the list.\n   * Save and exit. The system should now attempt to boot from the USB stick first.\n\n4. **Boot into Ubuntu \u201cTry\u201d mode**\n   * When the boot menu appears, select **\u201cTry Ubuntu without installing.\u201d** This loads a live session that can be used to access your internal SSD, back up data, or reinstall drivers.\n\n5. **Recover the system**\n   * Once in the live session you can:\n     - Mount the internal NVMe partition and copy important files to an external drive.\n     - Re\u2011install or downgrade NVIDIA drivers if they are causing the loop.\n     - Use `nvflash`/`nvidia-installer` tools from the live environment to clean up driver remnants.\n\n6. **Optional \u2013 Create a permanent recovery USB**\n   * A community tutorial (link omitted for brevity) shows how to build a custom live USB with Timeshift and pre\u2011installed NVIDIA drivers. This can be kept on a separate drive for future recovery.\n\n**Why this works** \u2013 The DGX\u202fSpark\u2019s ARM processor cannot boot an x86 image, and Secure\u202fBoot blocks unsigned kernels. By disabling Secure\u202fBoot and using a proper ARM64 Ubuntu ISO, the system bypasses the corrupted NVIDIA driver loop and gives you a working environment to repair or back up your data.\n\nIf the live USB still doesn\u2019t appear in the boot list, double\u2011check that the BIOS is set to **Legacy/UEFI** mode compatible with the USB format, and confirm that the USB is inserted into a port that supports booting. Once you have a successful live session, you can proceed with reinstalling or updating TensorRT from the correct packages."

The specification states that ECC is **not** provided on this memory; the LPDDR5X modules do not include error\u2011correcting code. Some on\u2011die ECC may detect errors, but it does not offer the full protection that a dedicated ECC memory array would.\n\nScaling beyond two units: The underlying network protocol for the Connect\u2011X7 ports is standard Ethernet.

No Spark\u2011specific configuration is required; the devices will appear as normal Ethernet endpoints. The main limiting factors in a larger cluster are:\n\n* **Bandwidth** \u2013 each port is 200\u202fGbps, so a switch must provide sufficient aggregate throughput to avoid bottlenecks.\n* **Topology** \u2013 a simple daisy\u2011chain of Connect\u2011X7 cables will share the 200\u202fGbps link, whereas a switch can provide full\u2011mesh connectivity.\n* **Software support** \u2013 while the hardware permits more than two nodes, NVIDIA\u2019s current software stack is validated for dual\u2011node clusters.

        "value": "The DGX\u202fSpark (SoC) uses a unified\u2011memory architecture in which the GPU and CPU share the same address space. For performance reasons, however, the memory that is allocated by the GPU (for example with\u202fcudaMalloc) cannot be coherently accessed by the CPU or by PCI\u2011Express peripherals. Because of this limitation the GPUDirect\u202fRDMA feature is **not supported** on the Spark platform.\n\nConsequently, mechanisms that rely on GPUDirect RDMA \u2013 such as the\u202fnvidia\u2011peermem kernel module, dma\u2011buf or GDRCopy \u2013 will not work. The peermem module that ships with the Spark image is effectively empty; it fails to load because the build flag that pulls in the Mellanox IB symbols (NV_MLNX_IB_PEER_MEM_SYMBOLS_PRESENT) is not set \u2013 the Spark image does not include the DOCA\u2011OFED drivers.\n\n**How to proceed**\n\nA compliant application should check the platform capabilities at run time. On CUDA you can query:\n\n* `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_GPU_DIRECT_RDMA_SUPPORTED` \u2013 indicates whether the device supports GPUDirect RDMA.\n* `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_DMA_BUF_SUPPORT` \u2013 indicates whether dma\u2011buf based sharing is available.\n\nIf either of these attributes reports that the feature is unsupported, fall back to a supported method. For Linux RDMA applications that use the verbs API, the recommended approach is:\n\n1. Allocate a pinned host buffer with `cudaHostAlloc` (or the newer `cudaMallocManaged` with appropriate flags).\n2. Register that buffer with the verbs library using `ib_reg_mr`.\n\nThis path works on all platforms, including the DGX\u202fSpark, and provides efficient zero\u2011copy data movement between GPU memory and RDMA devices.\n\nIn short, GPUDirect\u202fRDMA is not available on the DGX\u202fSpark; use pinned\u2011host memory registration as a portable alternative."

        "thought": "I extracted the key points from the forum thread: architecture mismatch (amd64 vs arm), CUDA version difference, and lack of official DCGM support on DGX Spark. I structured the answer as a concise troubleshooting guide with commands and an important note about support."

        "value": "The problem is not with your cluster configuration or memory settings; it comes from an incompatibility between the TensorRT\u2011LLM version that ships with the playbooks and the Qwen3 model. The playbook documentation does not specify a required TensorRT\u2011LLM release, but the logs show that the environment is using 1.0.0rc3. If you install a newer release (e.g., 1.2.0rc1) the model fails to load, and even the final 1.0.0 release does not work. Downgrading to TensorRT\u2011LLM\u202f1.0.0rc3 restores compatibility and the model loads successfully. In short, when deploying Qwen3\u2011235B\u2011A22B\u2011FP4 on the DGX Spark playbooks, use TensorRT\u2011LLM\u202f1.0.0rc3.",

They handle all post\u2011order logistics, including FedEx delivery exceptions and special access requests.\n\n**How to get help quickly**\n1. **Open a support ticket** through the NVIDIA Customer Support portal (https://developer.nvidia.com/support). Select \u201cDGX\u202fSpark\u201d as the product and describe the delivery exception, the need for locker access, and the signature requirement.\n2. **Email** your NVIDIA account manager or the DGX\u202fSpark support email (typically support@dgx.nvidia.com) with the same details. Include your order number, tracking ID, and any FedEx communication.\n3. **Call** the NVIDIA support line if you need immediate assistance; a representative can forward your request to the DGX\u202fSpark team and expedite an authorization.\n\nOnce the support team receives your request, they will issue a delivery\u2011authorization code or coordinate with FedEx to allow the package to be left in your smart locker (or released for pickup). This resolves both the signature requirement and the access restriction.\n\n**Key points to mention in your request**\n- Order number and tracking ID\n- Delivery exception details (FedEx \u201cCustomer not available or business closed\u201d)\n- Your building\u2019s access restrictions and the smart locker system\n- The need for a signature\u2011free delivery or pickup authorization\n\nFollowing these steps should result in the fastest resolution and ensure your DGX\u202fSpark arrives safely.",
